# Learn Python Programming Chatbot

This repository contains the code for a Python chatbot that helps users learn Python programming by answering questions and providing information related to Python programming concepts. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input.

## Features

- **Greeting**: The chatbot responds to common greetings and welcomes users to learn Python programming.
- **Information Retrieval**: Users can ask questions related to Python programming, and the chatbot retrieves relevant information from a corpus of Python programming tutorials.
- **Interactive Learning**: The chatbot provides interactive learning experiences by engaging users in conversations about Python programming topics.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-python-chatbot.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. Interact with the chatbot in your terminal and start learning Python programming!

## Usage

- Upon running the chatbot, you can type greetings like "hello" or "hi" to initiate a conversation with the chatbot.
- Ask questions related to Python programming, such as "What is a list comprehension?" or "How do I define a function in Python?"
- Type "exit" or "bye" to end the conversation with the chatbot.
